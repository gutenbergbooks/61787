<p>Come with us, all you who are new to the city or you who
bid fair to live and die in Lincoln without ever having seen her
various faces. We&rsquo;ll teach you in&mdash;well, we don&rsquo;t know how
many lessons&mdash;something about the city in which you are living.</p>
<p>Maybe we should begin with the capitol, known over the
world for its beauty. But we
think we&rsquo;ll start with that handy
starting and stopping place, O
street. Lincoln is often described
as an overgrown country town, O
its Main street. But even New
York has its lapses into the primitive,
and who doesn&rsquo;t like, in medium
doses, the simplicity and the
friendliness that spell country
town.</p>
<p>When Lincoln was only a handful
of blocks flung down on the
prairie for hasty habitation by
early salt seekers, restless young
Civil war veterans, the railroad
advance guard and those with an
incurable pioneer fever, it huddled
within the confines of what is now
the most downtown part of Lincoln.
Along O from Eighth to
Fourteenth were its beginnings.
The town spread slowly, like extremely
cold molasses, into an indefinite
shape with an undulating
circumference at the present time
of about 20 miles.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s O street, looking from
Tenth east. Most of Lincoln&rsquo;s
buses head up O to Tenth, rolling
around government square and
then rolling back to O again. You
can&rsquo;t get lost in Lincoln. Just
keep one foot, or at least an eye,
on O and say your alphabet north
and south. Or on Thirteenth and
say your numbers east and west.
And then there are a few streets
on the edges with fancier names,
just to make it a little harder.</p>

<p>This city is one of 25 cities
or towns in the United States
sharing the name of Lincoln.
Sixteen of these 25 were named
for Abraham Lincoln. It is perhaps
not unduly vain to say
that Lincoln, Neb., is most noted
of these Lincolns. To begin with,
it is the capital of a state, and
that state is the geographical
center of the North American
continent.</p>
<p>Among other things which
have drawn attention to this
city of 81,000 are its illustrious
one-time citizens. From the
home base of Lincoln William
Jennings Bryan spattered the
country with silver words about
the silver standard. General
Pershing was one of the Atlases
on whose shoulders the weight
of the first World war rested.
Charles G. Dawes, a dynamic
young lawyer of Lincoln in the
80&rsquo;s, eventually became a vice
president. Willa Cather, precocious
university student in the
90&rsquo;s, at the height of her writing
career was conceded to be this
country&rsquo;s most gifted woman
writer. Charles Lindbergh is
claimed by Lincoln after a
fashion and with some degree of
justification. It was here that
he learned the art of flying,
after trundling into town unobtrusively
on a day in April&mdash;April
Fool&rsquo;s day in fact&mdash;1922.
And there are many other
notables whose names are in
some way linked with the city.</p>
<p>The famous sculptor, Daniel
Chester French, left behind him
several famous statues of Abraham
Lincoln. One of these has
stood on the capitol grounds
since its dedication, Sept. 2,
1912. As the new, and fifth,
Nebraska capitol burgeoned
slowly it elbowed off the
grounds every vestige of the
outgrown capitol with one exception&mdash;the
Lincoln statue. It
is something difficult to outgrow.</p>

<p>Lincoln was chosen as the
capital of Nebraska in the summer
of 1867 by three young men,
David Butler, John Gillespie and
Thomas Kennard, who had been
named as a commission to do
this task. They have become
almost legendary figures in the
minds of Nebraskans&mdash;three
men in tall silk hats silhouetted
against the prairie sky as they
pounded their ponies over the
countryside in search of a capital
site.</p>
<p>They were very actual people,
however; Butler was the state of
Nebraska&rsquo;s first governor;
Thomas Kennard, first secretary
of state and Gillespie first state
auditor. Interestingly, the homes
built by these three men still
stand, perhaps the three oldest
houses in Lincoln. Herewith is
shown the one-time mansion of
Governor Butler, which has
stood at Seventh and Washington
for almost 75 years. At
that time of course there were
no such streets. The mansion
was a country home, from which
the governor drove to the capitol
and back in state.</p>
<p>The original house was square
and high. Built of blocks of
brown stone with a cupola and
a front stoop instead of a porch
it was considered very imposing.
Here Governor Butler lived
from about 1867 until his impeachment
in 1871. The impeachment
by the legislature
came about because of Butler&rsquo;s
borrowing $17,000 from the
school fund. Land which he had
deeded to the state was said to
have more than paid in value
the amount borrowed, and great
bitterness resulted from the legislature&rsquo;s
action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord&rdquo; Jones, a rich Englishman,
purchased the building in
the early 70&rsquo;s. Thirty years
later the Lincoln Country club
took it over and added wings.
The mansion has been used
variously since as the home of
the ku klux klan, a radio broadcasting
studio and a dance
house. Now, hands patiently
folded, it awaits the auctioneer&rsquo;s
hammer.</p>

</div>
<p>Like the Butler mansion, the
Kennard house at 1627 H was
built in the late 60&rsquo;s. Exteriorly
it has been little changed and
indicates fairly well the style of
the more pretentious houses of
that period.</p>
<p>Thomas Kennard was a colorful
figure of the times. On the
streets of the raw prairie city
he sported a frock coat, black
velvet vest and a silk hat, which
was perhaps legitimate dress for
a man of his importance. He
had helped select Lincoln as the
capital of Nebraska. Later he
was railroad attorney, state
senator and an appraiser of Indian
lands for the federal government.
In 1890 he organized
the Western Glass &amp; Paint company,
still in existence. In 1898
he was appointed by President
McKinley receiver of public
moneys at the U. S. land office
in Lincoln.</p>
<p>Choosing a site for the capitol
was not as simple as it
sounds 75 years later. Omaha
clung to the honor with grim
fingers. Ashland was bitter at
not being chosen. The $50,000
bonds of the commissioners had
been filed with the chief justice,
but not with the state treasurer,
as the law specified. Disgruntled
Omaha people said the
commissioners therefore had no
legal standing and they planned
to prevent the removal of the
state papers, and in fact the
capital, to Lincoln by having an
injunction issued. Gov. Butler
and Mr. Kennard formulated a
plan. On Sunday morning Mr.
Kennard drove to Omaha, entered
the state house, took the
seal of state, wrapped it up
carefully and put it under the
seat of his buggy. He arrived in
Lincoln next morning after stopping
in Ashland overnight. The
governor&rsquo;s proclamation, ready
and waiting, that morning announced
that the capital was
now removed.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennard lived to celebrate
his 90th birthday. He was by
that time a gentle old man in
quiet dress, yet about him still
hovered, one felt, the aura of the
empire builder.</p>

</div>
<p>The official milestone of Lincoln,
standing in front of the
city hall at 10th and P, has
caused considerable comment,
mostly favorable, since it was
placed there in 1926. The suitability
of the covered wagon
idea and the manner of execution
are not questioned. This
very portion of Lincoln was
alive with prairie schooners, not
always drawn by oxen however,
in the first 30 years of the city&rsquo;s
existence&mdash;tied to the hitching
posts, relaxing in government
square for the night. The editor
of The Journal often put his
head out the window and
counted the wagons on the
square. Then he drew it back
and sat down&mdash;not to his typewriter,
in those days&mdash;and told
his readers how many new settlers
were coming into the state.
Sometimes they needed encouragement,
when grasshoppers
were thick or dry dust piled
high.</p>
<p>The only critical note indicated
in comment is the fact
that the prairie schooner is
headed east instead of west.
That seems to indicate the back-home
defeatist attitude rather
than the on-to-victory pioneer
spirit.</p>
<p>The city hall itself was built
early in the city&rsquo;s history ...
1874. For 50 years it grew
dingier and dingier. Then a
sandman polished it off and it
showed up as an attractive edifice
made of limestone&mdash;quarried
near the Platte river. The
texture of its surface contrasts
pleasingly with the smoother
face of the postoffice building.</p>
<p>The city hall was first Lincoln&rsquo;s
postoffice. Not until 1906
was the first section of the present
postoffice built. Until then
the city edifice was on the present
site of the municipal building
on Q street.</p>

<p>Today The Journal stars itself in this column. Justifiably,
we believe. For it was 75 years ago&mdash;Sept. 7, 1867&mdash;that the
first issue of the paper was brought forth, at Nebraska City,
five weeks after the capital of the state of Nebraska was declared
to be in existence. The next and all subsequent issues
came out in Lincoln.</p>
<p>The present Journal building, at
Ninth and P, has stood here almost
60 years. The life story of
this world has pulsed thru it
ceaselessly. Daily, feet have
stormed up and down its steps,
bearing humdrum news or perhaps
a local bombshell of information.
Loftily above, news from the outside
has poured in over singing
wires, every day occurrences of
the world or sometimes catastrophic
tidings.</p>
<p>On these steps stood Willa
Cather, journalist of the nineties,
a dauntless young female who
nevertheless gazed about her
fearfully after nightfall. For Ninth
street in the nineties, and after
dark, was a dubious spot. Up these
steps to write his daily column
reeled Walt Mason, for he had not
yet reached Kansas and fame, and
reform at the hands of William
Allen White.</p>
<p>Noted people of the day sometimes
came and went&mdash;sometimes
a person with a grievance and a
club. For newspapers of earlier
days were amazingly flatfooted in
their remarks. But come threat,
come flood, come wars or disasters,
the presses turned on, into
the new century and now almost
half a century past the turn.</p>

</div>
<p>Of Lincoln&rsquo;s downtown
churches, St. Paul Methodist is
most completely downtown. At
12th and M, the tides of business
and everyday life flow all about
it. It has weathered into its
place, a hospitable building
where passersby are welcome.
St. Paul has been a boon to Lincoln
during a good many years,
at periods when the city was
short of meeting places&mdash;and
these periods have been frequent.
St. Paul&rsquo;s is big, it is
very conveniently located. At
the price of a crushed rib (and
admission) one has been able to
hear many stirring performances&mdash;Paderewski
and other
famous musicians, addresses of
the great.</p>
<p>The crushed rib should not,
however, be charged against the
Methodists. Their serious purpose
in 1867 was to organize a
church in the new city. They
expected to fling their doors
open principally for church comers,
and, sadly, huge entrances
are not necessary to take care
of the average church congregation.</p>
<p>The first church was put up
in 1868&mdash;the First Methodist
Episcopal church of Lincoln. In
1883 a new structure was erected
and the name changed to
St. Paul Methodist. In 1899 this
building burned and two years
later the present structure was
completed. Among attractive
features of the church are its
two great windows on the east
and south.</p>
<p>Dr. Walter Aitken, who resigned
in 1942, had been pastor
of St. Paul church 22 years.</p>

</div>
<p>The photographer surprised us
with this attractive picture of
the Lancaster county courthouse,
a testimonial to his art
or to our lack of perception.
Our initial impression of the
courthouse was gained from the
third story of The Journal
building in the days when it still
wore a conventional round dome,
on top of which was perched a
sad castiron statue of Abraham
Lincoln. Once a painter clambered
up and gave the statue a
coat of bright red paint. Protests
poured in. It developed
that the red was only preliminary
to a more suitable bronze.
But eventually dome and statue
disappeared, with pleasing results.</p>
<p>In its 55 years the courthouse
has seen drama. The most sensational
trials held within its
walls were during the tumultuous
90&rsquo;s&mdash;the John Sheedy, Irvine-Montgomery,
George Washington
Davis and Lillie cases.
Sheedy was Lincoln&rsquo;s kingpin
gambler of the 90&rsquo;s, a large
handsome person who was found
at his office with skull crushed.
His beautiful young wife and a
Negro, Monday MacFarland,
were tried and acquitted. W. H.
Irvine was tried for the fatal
shooting of C. E. Montgomery,
a Lincoln banker, and exonerated.
Mrs. Lillie, found guilty
of killing her husband at David
City and later pardoned by
Governor Mickey, here forced
the Woodman company to pay
her insurance for the death of
the husband whom a jury had
convicted her of killing.</p>
<p>George Washington Davis, a
Negro, loosened part of the Rock
Island track southeast of the
penitentiary with the idea of
notifying the company and
securing a job as a reward. He
notified them too late. There
was a train wreck and 12 were
killed. Davis was convicted.</p>
<p>A later incident was the trial
of iron-faced Frank Sharp, found
guilty of the brutal hammer
murder of his wife.</p>

<p>Hats off! The flag...! Shade your
eyes down this vista and summon
your imagination. Do you see, falling
across these columns, the
shadow of a great president and
hear out of the past the distant
marching of feet and the sound
of muted fife and drum?</p>
<p>These columns at the O street
entrance of Antelope park, between
23rd and 24th, were once a
part of the old federal building in
Washington. Standing between
them Abraham Lincoln once reviewed
the Civil war troops. Easterners,
who live in an atmosphere
crowded with reminders of the historic
great, would smile at such
a thin fancy&mdash;at attempting somehow
to draw Abraham Lincoln
across the Missouri river. So far
as history shows, the east bank of
the Missouri is as far west as
Lincoln ever traveled. In the early
years of the 60&rsquo;s he was the guest
of General Dodge in Council
Bluffs, invited there to help decide
where the eastern terminal of
the Union Pacific should be. As
we recall an early account, Lincoln
stood on the bank of the Missouri
and gazed westward, but
even &ldquo;on a clear day&rdquo; such as we
like to boast of from the Missouri
on west, he could hardly have seen
the little village which later would
bear his name.</p>
<p>When the treasury building was
remodeled in 1907 these sandstone
columns were bought by Cotter
T. Bride of Washington, a personal
friend of William Jennings
Bryan. He presented them to the
city of Lincoln in 1916.</p>
<p>Halfway between the columns is
a bronze tablet relating the origin
of the pillars. The tablet, weighing
450 pounds and made from
material saved from the battleship
Maine, was presented to the
city by the U. S. W. V.</p>

<p>Of the 2,811 libraries which
Andrew Carnegie magnanimously
scattered over this globe
before his death in 1919, five
stand in Lincoln&mdash;a generous
proportion, surely. Perhaps we
would not have shared his
bounty so fully had it not been
that libraries in University
Place, College View and Havelock
were secured when these
sections of Lincoln were still
towns in their own right.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. W. J. Bryan interceded
to secure a Carnegie
building for Lincoln proper the
library was as wandering as a
poor sharecropper, and burned
out about as often. It ceased
its nomadic life in 1900, beginning
in that year a dignified and
permanent existence at Fourteenth
and N.</p>
<p>We have it from the librarian,
Magnus Kristoffersen, that as
many as 2,000 people have been
known to walk up the library
steps in one day&mdash;to take out
books or to linger and read.
That sounds like a great many
people and it probably doesn&rsquo;t
happen often. Even so, the
library is doubtless one of the
city&rsquo;s valuable assets. The building
is richly lined with 160,000
volumes, written by the great,
the near great or the fleetingly
great authors of all time. No
wonder readers come often to
draw mental and spiritual sustenance
therefrom.</p>
<p>An attentive staff and a carefully
worked system make access
to books easy at any of the
library buildings. Two branches
not mentioned above are Northeast
at 27th and Orchard and
Bethany at 1551 No. Cotner.</p>
<p>Any Lincoln resident, any
child attending Lincoln schools,
anyone attending college here or
anyone owning property and
paying taxes to the city will be
issued a borrower&rsquo;s card, good
at any of the city&rsquo;s libraries. In
addition to regular activities,
service is given the three principal
Lincoln hospitals. A still
newer feature is the bookmobile,
which makes five stops in the
city.</p>

<p>William Jennings Bryan, who
spotlighted Lincoln from the
nineties on, died in 1925, shortly
after the famous Scopes trial in
Tennessee. He had gone to
that state to thunder disapproval
of John T. Scopes, who
was being tried for teaching
evolution, contrary to Tennessee
law. It is believed that Bryan&rsquo;s
death was hastened by his vigorous
efforts in behalf of fundamentalism.</p>
<p>It is interesting to gaze upon
this modest church&mdash;Normal
Methodist, 55th and South&mdash;which
Bryan attended after his
removal to Fairview, and reflect
that here, doubtless, were
built up the religious convictions
which accompanied him&mdash;perhaps
hastened him&mdash;to his
grave. Not always did he occupy
one of the old fashioned
stained oak benches. Often he
spoke from the carved pulpit,
his hand upon the old metal-clasped
Bible, his pontifical
and mellow voice filling the
little church.</p>
<p>What W. J. Bryan believed he
believed with great sincerity and
articulateness. First intimations
of his gifts as an orator came
with the impassioned silver
speech in 1896 in which he declared:
&ldquo;You shall not press
down upon the brow of labor
this crown of thorns; you shall
not crucify mankind upon a
cross of gold.&rdquo; His contemporaries
did not always agree with
the Great Commoner, but they
could not do otherwise than respect
his sincerity. He fought
for the silver standard, for
peace, for prohibition, for fundamentalism,
often losing but
never giving up the fight.</p>
<p>His lion&rsquo;s face and mane, his
broad hat, his golden voice, are
gone, but gashes of his reform
ax may still be seen on the
surface of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>For years preceding and following
the turn of the century
9th street was definitely a street
of wickedness. In fact it was
dedicated to the ways of wickedness&mdash;it
and the shadowy region
west, extending down to about
K street. There was a law on
the books against the sort of
houses that filled the redlight
district, but instead of enforcing
it the police exacted tribute.
Every first Monday of the month
proprietresses in silks and
plumes rustled into the city hall
and majestically laid down their
gold. As the rate was, we are
told, about $15 for inmates and
$25 for managers per month,
they left a considerable stack on
the municipal desk. Most of it
went into the public school
coffers.</p>
<p>This noisome neighborhood
kept police busy. No mere saunter
up to the station for a list
of parking offenders was the
police run in those hectic days.
Often a brief telephone call&mdash;murder
or/and suicide at Rose&rsquo;s
or Rae&rsquo;s or Kitty&rsquo;s, took police
and reporters hopping. The district
was finally closed by the
expedient of enforcing the law.
The man undertaking this revolutionary
method of procedure
was Co. Atty. Frank Tyrrell.</p>
<p>One of the well known notorious
houses, known as Lydia&rsquo;s
place, stood at 124 So. 9th st.
This same building, cleansed in
purpose and aspect, was a number
of years ago turned into the
City Mission by interested Lincoln
churches. At the top of the
house a lighted star now beckons
shabby wayfarers to a free
meal and night&rsquo;s lodging. Looking
in at the mission any evening
one may see, not parading
painted women in short skirts,
smoking cigarets&mdash;unmistakable
marks of sin in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s&mdash;but
seated derelicts lending
their cauliflower ears to the
nightly religious service.</p>

<p>When a blond young man, silent
and tall, brought his smoking
motorcycle to rest in front
of E. J. Sias&rsquo;s airplane and flying
school at 2415 O, on April
fool&rsquo;s day, 1922, he probably had
no idea, and certainly Lincoln
had no idea, that what he
learned at the flying school
would one day catapult him into
fame. Unnoticed Charles Lindbergh
traversed the streets of
Lincoln, quiet and untalkative.</p>
<p>After his spectacular air voyage
of May 20-21, 1927&mdash;spectacular
and yet on his part made
as quietly as his entrance into
Lincoln five years before, the
flying school suddenly became
a mecca. Young men were siphoned
out of Australia, Scotland,
China, New Guinea and
dumped at the door of the school&mdash;young
men talking in divers
tongues but speaking the same
language aeronautically. Since
the war started men in uniform
have almost cracked the walls
of the aeronautical institute.</p>
<p>The name of E. J. Sias is
synonymous now with the words
flying school. But 30 years ago
he was the energetic young
minister who plucked Tabernacle
Christian church out of a
cocked hat before the startled
eyes of south Lincoln. One day,
June 21, 1912, he and a group
in his home thought up a
Christian church in that part of
the city. Two days later they
met and planned a building and
60 men volunteered to put up a
structure between morning light
and evening dark. The heat of
late June prevented quite this
much of a miracle, but anyway,
on June 30, nine days after the
initial meeting, the tabernacle
was ready for occupancy.
Rather, it was occupied&mdash;by 800
people listening to the dedicatory
sermon. This building sufficed
its congregation ten years.
By that time Mr. Sias was deep
in something else&mdash;flying.</p>

<p>The postoffice is a noble building,
filling half a block on P street
between Ninth and Tenth. But,
mysteriously, filtered thru a picture-taker&rsquo;s
lens it takes on the
appearance of a toy model still
sitting on the architect&rsquo;s desk.
This is most deceiving. It is really
a handsome and majestic building,
of Bedford stone, standing very
massively on its green lawn.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just a postoffice, as you
learned when you were initiated
into the Income Taxpayers lodge.
Also, if you want to ask how
about that money you&rsquo;re going to
get from Uncle Sam when 65,
how about a loan for putting up
a hog house, how about keeping
the black dirt on your farm from
drifting into the Missouri, how
about enlisting in the army or
navy, you go to the postoffice&mdash;and
also the FBI will reach out
from the postoffice and get you
if you don&rsquo;t watch out. If the
United States wants to try you
for some federal offense, that&rsquo;s
where the trial will be. Having
steered clear of this court, the
only case we recall offhand is
the Nye committee hearing in the
Grocer Norris senatorial case.</p>
<p>The first federal court was held
in November 1864, in a log building
on the south side of O between
Seventh and Eighth. Elmer
S. Dundy was the judge. The
postoffice was run by Jacob Dawson
in conjunction with a grocery
in the front end, so that office
and courtroom were enlivened with
the smell of codfish, coffee and
tobacco. Somewhere within the
log cabin and between the codfish
and the cases at bar Mr. Dawson
kept house&mdash;it may be with
the help of a Mrs. Dawson, but
one can read early histories of
Lincoln from preface to index
without finding mention of a
woman, so thoroly was the sex
still in subjugation.</p>
<p>The postoffice began taking on
dignity in 1879 when it moved
into its new building on government
square, now the city hall.
The first section of the present
building was put up in 1906; the
last, which made it the impressive
edifice it is today, only a year
or two ago.</p>

<p>Some day when you emerge
from the Varsity, 13th and P,
and look up at the weather
your eyes may come to rest on
&ldquo;The Oliver&rdquo; in old fashioned
lettering on the battlements of
the ancient building, and for a
moment you may idly wonder
about the playhouse&rsquo;s past. It
does in truth have considerable
past, reckoned in terms of famous
actors who trod its boards,
of orators who thundered in debate
over silver and gold standards,
suffrage for women and
other problems of the past.</p>
<p>The theater, first known as
The Lansing, opened in 1891
with Ed Church in charge, and
with Lillian Lewis and her company
gracing the stage in
&ldquo;L&rsquo;Article 47&rdquo; with the sinister
subhead &ldquo;The trail of the serpent
is overall.&rdquo; Yet Gen. Victor
Vifquain, rhapsodizing in the
opening night souvenir booklet,
said: &ldquo;The Lansing will become
an athaeneum where a husband
can take his wife and daughter,
the brother and sister without
fear of bringing a blush upon
the cheeks of those whose modesty
is of priceless value to them
and to the community of which
they are the ornaments and the
pride.&rdquo; Anyway, it was a good
old chest-expanding sentence.</p>
<p>A Journal man who has attended
shows at this theater off
and on for 50 years gives us
the following list of famous
players he recalls having seen
at the Lansing (later Oliver):
John Drew, Ethel Barrymore,
Edwin Booth, Laurence Barrett,
Joe Jefferson, Emma Eames, Sol
Smith Russell, Blanche Bates,
Billie Burke, George M. Cohan,
Weber &amp; Fields, Willie Collier,
Otis Skinner, Maxine Elliott,
Robert Mantell, Elsie DeWolfe,
Nat Goodwin, Dustin Farnam,
Minnie Maddern Fiske, Trixie
Fraganza, DeWolfe Hopper,
Virginia Harned, Elsie Janis,
Margaret Illington, Mary Mannering,
Julia Marlowe, E. H.
Sothern, Lillian Nordica, Alice
Nielsen, Chauncey Olcott, May
Robson, Eleanor Robson, Stuart
Robson, Madame Modjeska.</p>
<p>Vividly connected with the
history of the theater, as it is
with Lincoln itself, is the name
of Frank C. Zehrung, to whom
death came recently. For almost
70 years a citizen of Lincoln,
he was for perhaps half
that time manager of the Oliver.</p>

</div>
<p>Before winter puts out a white
hand to stay us (which we trust
won&rsquo;t be soon, altho there are
hints of early frost), it would be
pleasant to make a tour of Lincoln
gardens. However, we
wouldn&rsquo;t want to flatten our
sight-seeing noses against front
windows, and the gardens which
can be seen entire from the street
are few. In a simpler day, we
Americans put our iron deer and
dogs, petunias and hollyhocks in
a big front yard and then naively
sat on our big front porches to
see passersby and have passersby
see our elegant homes and lawns.
Now that we have grown more
subtle and English and hide gardens
in the back and put inscrutable
faces on our houses, seeing
gardens on a tour isn&rsquo;t so easy.
But the gardens are there and
one can get pleasing glimpses.</p>
<p>Imagine a Lincoln in which all
the houses perched desolately on
barren lots. Not a tree, not a curving
path, not a flower. Then you
will indeed appreciate those
patient and imaginative garden
lovers who with a few rocks, seeds,
hoes and hoses turn desert lots
into oases. There are pretty little
gardens around modest houses,
large beautiful gardens around
mansions, altogether making Lincoln
a charming lady of gardens.</p>
<p>Peer with us thru Dr. Harry
Everett&rsquo;s gates at 2433 Woodscrest
for a glimpse of his delightful
ivory complexioned house with
its maroon awnings and blue windows,
and his formal garden. Dr.
Everett is an iris specialist and
is or has been president of the
national iris society.</p>
<p>So charming is this quiet scene,
with the September sun falling in
bars across the lawn, the soldierly
evergreens silently on guard, that
even the sudden appearance of
five beautiful senoritas on the five
balconies would be an intrusion
not to be desired.</p>

</div>
<p>Doubtless you know the delightful
and intimate sound of rain
which only a staunch immediate
attic roof keeps off your face.
Walking into the Chapin home at
3805 Calvert one has a similar
pleasurable sensation. It is a
beautiful house, and of course actually
very protective, yet one has
the feeling of being near the earth&mdash;still
in the garden. This possibly
comes from walking into it levelly
from broad low flagstones. Inside
one looks out thru great wide-eyed
windows so flawless that he
seems not to be separated from
the rock garden and its mountain
stream or the green plush lawn
which falls away into the wood.</p>
<p>We grew up near the woods, but
&ldquo;the wood&rdquo; seems more suitable
for this fairy house (glorified
French peasant). And the nicest
thing about these trees which circle
the Chapins&rsquo; two and a half
acres is that they are original ones
and came along free with Nebraska.
Luckily the recent dry
years&mdash;do you remember them&mdash;did
not affect the small forest, in
which hundreds of birds sing.</p>
<p>Inside, as the earth slowly turns,
the Chapins can watch the seasons
as on a stage, or as a great
framed picture turning slowly
from green to russet and brown,
from brown to white. On the sloping
green outside a silver gazing
globe pictures the lawn in miniature.</p>
<p>One could exclaim over
many things&mdash;the garden to the
north, where a thousand gladioli
grow&mdash;the balcony from which one
half expects a pretty peasant girl
or a blessed damozel to lean.</p>

</div>
<p>What, in the words of the atrocious
daily puzzle of that name, is
wrong with this picture? Very
easy indeed. No angels in flat
heels and sweaters are ascending
and descending the stairs. Actually,
they have begun the continuous
zigzag on the Student Union steps
for the season. They may be going
to or coming from a spot of
lunch in the Corn Crib, a friendly
coke, bridge or pingpong, time out
on the marshmallow upholstery of
the lounge, or a late afternoon
hour dance.</p>
<p>And cease your sighs and murmurs
that when you and I were young
we had lessons to get and nobody
put us up a Student Union building.
For one thing, the tots may
have mastered all lessons up to
and including next Tuesday morning.
For another, the building is
theirs, or will be in 80,000 easy
payments. At six dollars a year,
10,000 university educations laid
end to end ought to about close
the Student Union books.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it&rsquo;s well worth two
and a half cents a day to city
campus students, especially the
ones who have made no entangling
alliances with fraternity or
sorority, and they&rsquo;re in the great
majority&mdash;probably 75 percent.
Here&rsquo;s a place to do almost anything
you can think of&mdash;or they
can think of, which is more comprehensive.</p>
<p>In the basement are offices of
student publications, Awgwan,
Cornhusker and Daily Nebraskan
and a ping-pong room. Office of
building manager, grill room, cafeteria,
lounges and book nook are
on first. On second floor are offices
of alumni association, university
foundation and University
speakers bureau, ballroom, dining
rooms, game room and faculty
lounge. Dining rooms and student
organization rooms occupy the
third floor. Mortar Board and Innocents
have fourth-floor dormer
rooms.</p>

<p>To get the desired three by four
inch view of Nebraska&rsquo;s stadium
a photographer might walk
around it seven times and his pursuit
would still be in vain, for it
ovals away from him endlessly.
One could get a pointblank shot
at it from the air, but empty seats,
even people enmasse, bundled in
blankets, aren&rsquo;t as attractive as
arched windows, which lend
beauty to the mammoth structure.
In the foreground of this picture
is the military department&rsquo;s reviewing
stand, which furnished
not only requisite proportions but
perspective suitable to the times,
war now having put college athletics
in the background with no
gentle hand.</p>
<p>The stadium, which holds 30,000
without the bleachers, is a memorial
to U. of N. men who have
died in the nation&rsquo;s wars. The
half million dollar cost was defrayed
by students, faculty,
alumni and friends. Many a tonsil
shredding joust has taken place
within the stadium&rsquo;s great arms.
The following from the helpful
typewriter of Walter Dobbins
gives details:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first game played on stadium
sod was with the Oklahoma
Sooners, Oct. 13, 1923, just a week
before dedication of the bowl.
With its building Nebraska became
a &lsquo;big time&rsquo; football school.
Games were scheduled with top
flight teams from north, south,
east and west. The largest crowd
ever packed into the home field
witnessed Nebraska&rsquo;s 7 to 0 victory
over Indiana Oct. 20, 1937.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of Nebraska&rsquo;s gridiron
triumphs have been recorded at
the stadium, including the amazing
14 to 7 victory over Notre
Dame&rsquo;s Four Horsemen in 1923;
the 17 to 0 win over Rockne&rsquo;s
eleven in 1924 and the last of the
11 game series with the Fighting
Irish. New York U.&rsquo;s national
title hopes were blasted on the
same field in 1926 and 1927.
Greatest of all victories, however,
are later ones&mdash;the 14 to 9 defeat
of Minnesota in 1937 and the 6-9
win over the Gophers in 1939.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="534" />
</div>
<p>This decapitated building may
look ready for the scrap heap, but
sentimental Nebraskans would indignantly
refuse to have it scrapped,
for it is the remains of the original
campus building. Once it
housed the university entire, even
offering sleeping room on the two
upper stories for men students.</p>
<p>First recollection invoked is of
&ldquo;Miss Bishop,&rdquo; Bess Streeter Aldrich&rsquo;s
filmed story of primitive
university life, which had its premiere
in Lincoln. Another is
Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s visit to the university
in the eighties. There, garbed
in his eccentric finery, he walked
unhappy as a strange cat, distressed
by the uncouthness of Nebraska
and its university and especially
by the ugly castiron stove
which heated the premises. After
expressing this distress, along with
his regular lecture, Wilde, in knee
breeches, buckled slippers and velvet
coat, shuddered his way back
to the Arlington hotel, 841 Q, and
was soon lost to this region forever.
Nobody was depressed over
his disapproval and irrepressible
Journal reporters put him and the
castiron stove into facetious
rhyme.</p>
<p>The cornerstone for U hall was
laid Sept. 23, 1869, with ceremonies&mdash;Masonic
ceremonies, in fact. An
Omaha brass band led a procession
and a thousand people banqueted&mdash;which
must have more
than depopulated residential Lincoln&mdash;then
danced until 4 in the
morning.</p>
<p>Lumber for the building was
shipped from Chicago to Nebraska
City and thence came slowly over
the hills in wagons. Brick was
burned in a kiln on Little Salt
creek. On Jan. 6, 1871, the doors
swung open and in walked ninety
young men and women. Rumors
that the building was unsafe continued
off and on for fifty years.
Every now and then some
propping was done. Finally the
two top floors and belltower were
taken off, but classes are still held
on the remaining first floor.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="603" />
</div>
<p>The beautiful new library,
now North Thirteenth&rsquo;s visual
shortstop, will make 1871-1942
students brothers to the pioneer
who slept, ate, cooked, played
and quarreled in one room. The
new edifice has a student
lounge, auditorium, social
studies reading room, general
and humanities reading room
and browsing room. Those who
did their lounging, their browsing,
their studying of the humanities
and their date making
all in one big room under an uncompromising
row of green
shaded lights will feel outmoded
indeed.</p>
<p>But casting envy aside, this
generous gift, one of several
from the late Don Love, is a
welcome addition to the campus
and the city. True, it turns its
back on the city as it communes
perpetually with its sisters of
The Quadrangle&mdash;teachers&rsquo; college,
social sciences and Andrews
hall&mdash;but it is a slender
ribbed, sightly and aristocratic
back. Earlier buildings were
sardine-packed on a small campus.
Later edifices, given space
on the avenue, took on social
graces. To the north of the
quadrangle, Memorial mall
forms the center of another
group of aristocrats&mdash;Morrill
hall, Bessey hall, Memorial stadium
and the Coliseum.</p>
<p>The new library is not yet
completed. We had wondered
if, when the day of occupancy
came, the former library would
go the way of the old cannon
which once stood guard beside
it. This cannon, brought to the
campus from the fortress of
Havana at the end of the Spanish-American
war, was dedicated
with ceremony as a memorial
to Nebraska students who
had fought for Cuban freedom.
The cannon had stood in Seville
in the time of Charles III of
Spain.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago the cannon
was ignominiously trucked off
for scrap, without ceremony or
apology. But the library is to
remain and will now house the
university&rsquo;s extension department.</p>

</div>
<p>That rugged old warrior,
Grant Memorial Hall (campus,
12th and S) now resounds to
commands no more stirring than
a set-up singsong to which co-eds
stretch muscles and limber
joints in accordance with university
physical education requirements.
It was built, however,
for sterner purposes. Once
the shuffle and click of guns
could be heard within its soldierly
exterior as Lt. John
Pershing sang out brisk orders
to his cadets. The hall was
erected in honor of Nebraska&rsquo;s
Civil war veterans in 1887,
when those veterans were comparatively
young men. Pershing
was commandant from 1891 to
1895. The military department
is now housed in Nebraska hall,
a block to the north.</p>
<p>During the university&rsquo;s middle
years convocations were held in
Grant Memorial. The pipe organ
in the west half of the
second story came from the Mississippi
exposition held in
Omaha in 1898. It was a gift
from alumni who purchased it
for $2,500. For years Carrie
Belle Raymond, for whom one
of the girls&rsquo; residence halls is
named, played the organ for
convocation. Thousands of
graduates recall her always
smiling face as she sat high
above them, fingers hovering
over the organ keys.</p>
<p>In Grant Memorial also are
housed the U. of N. radio studio
and the department of architecture.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="582" />
</div>
<p>With the exception of the
school of music, which began as
a private institution, The
Temple, at 12th and R, is the
only university building which
does not stand on the campus.
The reason for this seeming
ostracism of the Temple&mdash;indeed,
actual ostracism at the
time it was built, is that it was
a gift from John D. Rockefeller,
jr. The time was 1906, when
muckraking and Rockefeller
reviling were at their height.
Rockefeller had been a student
at Brown university when E.
Benjamin Andrews, in 1906
chancellor at Nebraska, was its
president.</p>
<p>The name of Rockefeller and
the smell of oil were offensive
to those who had to do with accepting
and placing buildings,
but the gift was not quite to be
refused. The Temple was delicately
dropped outside the gates.
However, the Temple has been a
useful and busy edifice these 35
years, and but for reporters with
fingers always crooked hungrily
over typewriter keys old ghosts
would not have been disturbed.
The Y. M. C. A. has used the
Temple for headquarters and
other innocent activities have
been housed therein.</p>
<p>Principally, however, the building
is known as the theater of
the University Players, Lincoln&rsquo;s
theatrical stock company, personnel
of which consists of instructors
and advanced students
of dramatic art. Six plays are
presented each university year.
Here Fred Ballard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Believe Me
Xantippe&rdquo; had its premiere&mdash;Mr.
Ballard being a university
student some 35 years ago. His
more recent &ldquo;Ladies of the
Jury&rdquo; also appeared here, but
not the premiere. A number of
the players have become known
elsewhere&mdash;Zolly Lerner, Augusta
French, Jack Rank and
others. The name of Miss H.
Alice Howell, for years director
of The Players, is inevitably
connected with this organization.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="578" />
</div>
<p>Morrill hall, 14th and U, is a
spot on the campus where everyone
is very welcome. In most
of the campus buildings, while
by no means barred, one is likely
to be run down by a horde of
young things charging to a
class. As they outstrip one on
the stairs he is left acutely
aware of his brittle old bones
and the fact that from college
days he can recall offhand only
two French verbs and one
theorem.</p>
<p>In this hall&mdash;named for Charles
H. Morrill, Nebraskan who
did a great deal for the university&mdash;you
may saunter and look,
and look and saunter. The art
galleries are in the two top
rooms, the museum on the two
below. Dwight Kirsch of the
university art department
caught this particular slant of
sun into the upper art gallery.</p>
<p>Like the native Chicagoan who
never heard of Hull House, we
know too little about what we
have at our own doors. The
Nebraska art association has
built up a fine collection of
paintings. Each year it holds an
exhibit, and the fact that it
buys one or more pictures every
year brings in a collection worth
inspecting. The late Mr. and
Mrs. F. M. Hall of Lincoln bequeathed
their collection to the
university, also a fund for further
purchases.</p>
<p>Among the valuable paintings
by modern artists owned by the
art association are the late
Grant Wood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arnold Comes of
Age,&rdquo; one of Thomas Hart Benton&rsquo;s
vigorous paintings, &ldquo;Lonesome
Road&rdquo; and John Steuart
Curry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Roadmender&rsquo;s Camp.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Most impressive, perhaps, of
the many interesting rooms in
the Morrill museum&mdash;two lower
floors of Morrill hall&mdash;is Elephant
hall. In this quiet room
time yawns, and down her great
throat one sees the endless vista
of the years. Here animals of
all eras, usually clad only in
their bones, confront one. If
you are sensitive to the ghostly
whispers of the past you might
well bring a companion. To
span millions of years alone in
an afternoon is too much; the
winds between as the centuries
whirl are too vigorous.</p>
<p>Last Saturday we gazed, alone
we believed, at a beautiful pair
of albino coyotes (Wheeler
county, Nebraska, 1940) with
touching blue eyes; at a
Peruvian mummy (pre-Inca)&mdash;a
baby with its little skull
resting on moth eaten arms;
at the skeleton of a dawn
horse, no higher than your knee,
dug up in Sioux county, and
were kneeling intent before a
reconstructed dodo when we
turned suddenly and encountered
the saturnine eye of the
ever present guard.</p>
<p>Rightly, the museum takes no
chances. Elephant hall contains
one of the best collections
of modern and fossil elephants
in the world, and in addition
real or reconstructed animals of
many ages. Backgrounds for
these reassembled bones of animals
which sniffed the earth
when it was new were painted
in delicate tints by Elizabeth
Dolan. The late Gutzon Borglum,
stepping into Elephant hall
in a woolly camelskin coat,
stopped in his tracks among the
ancient bones and murmured
paradoxically and appreciatively,
&ldquo;A new world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the activities of the
museum has been research on
the antiquity of man in North
America. Many discoveries have
been made in Nebraska, and one
of the few existing collections of
Yuma-Folsom artifacts is to be
found here.</p>

</div>
<p>The pattern has changed
since grandmother attended the
University of Nebraska in 1871.
Today&rsquo;s co-eds glide thru their
four years of college with a
minimum of discomfort. Grandmother
undoubtedly led a more
vigorous life, tho it cost her
less (but again, money was
money then). Lincoln&rsquo;s few
citizens were urged to be kind
to open up their homes to farmers&rsquo;
daughters bent on education.
Or she could stay at &ldquo;ladies
hall,&rdquo; which our sleuthing has
led us to believe stood at 14th
and U, for 50 cents a week if she
toted in her own bedstead.
Wherever she stayed, chances
are she often had to crack ice
on the water pitcher winter
mornings. And crossing the pasture
toward University hall in
temperate seasons she ran the
risk of falling over someone&rsquo;s
tethered-out cow.</p>
<p>In the evening grandmother
lighted her kerosene lamp in a
chilly room and sat down to her
lonely studies&mdash;perhaps with her
chilblained feet asoak. She was
more or less isolated, as phones
were still missing from the Lincoln
scene. If it had been arranged
in advance, she might
meet other young men and
women for a candy pull or
sleigh ride.</p>
<p>Now, in Carrie Belle Raymond,
Julia L. Love and Northeast
halls&mdash;on No. 16th&mdash;the
way of the co-ed is smooth. She
may roam at large over an area
predigested as to temperature,
blossoming with deep chairs,
radios, cardtables, piano, shampoo
rooms, dancing halls and
tennis courts. Fifteen sororities
in the region of the campus
furnish approximately the same
sort of living for grandmother&rsquo;s
granddaughter. Others take
their living places where they
find them. But even at the
worst those living places are
much superior to what was the
common lot in 1871.</p>

<p>To old timers, the Bryan home
is not the nurses&rsquo; residence at
Bryan Memorial hospital, but
the house at 1625 D. It was
while an occupant of this house
that fame suddenly embraced
William Jennings Bryan. From
it he went to two national conventions,
returning from each
with the democratic presidential
nomination. On his return he
addressed his people. A sea of
faces strained upward on D
from 16th to 17th as the sound
of his mellifluous voice flowed
out from the balcony on which
he was standing.</p>
<p>Here his two younger children
were born. From it, in a one
horse surrey, William Jennings
Bryan, in broad black hat, with
his wife and children, sallied
forth each Sunday afternoon for
a drive. In the backyard the
children&mdash;Ruth, later U. S. congresswoman
and minister to
Denmark, William jr. and Grace
dug an elaborate cave which
was the envy, and the daytime
abode, of neighbor children.</p>
<p>As late as 1935&mdash;when the
above picture was taken, the
house was much as it had been
built originally. Now the square
tower is gone the way of the
porch and balcony. The edifice
is corseted tight as an armadillo
in white asbestos shale. We offer
the original so that, driving
past, you may attempt to trace
it in the modern version. At
least it is an interesting example
of a 50 year old house rejuvenated.</p>
<p>Seven years ago the department
of the interior suggested
the old Bryan home as a historical
American building, worthy
of careful preservation.
There was some talk of making
a national shrine of the home in
which the Great Commoner had
experienced his greatest triumphs.
But the movement
drooped, and the old dwelling is
now tamely serving as a four
family apartment house.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Standing lonely on its hill this
old house, doubtless one of the
oldest in the region, is the only
visible evidence of one of Lancaster
county&rsquo;s early and to be
noticed citizens, John F. Cadman.
As time has shorn him of
earthly glory, so has it shorn the
house of pretentious tower and
galleries which graced it in its
original elegance as manor
house of Silver Lake farm. In
those days it was embellished
with laid-out garden and tree
plots, even a fountain.</p>
<p>Mr. Cadman was a man of
vigor and action. Coming to
Lancaster in 1859, he entered a
quarter section of land on Salt
creek, south of Lincoln. His
first move was to open a cut-off
(from the Oregon Trail) from
Nebraska City to Fort Kearny,
which he completed in time for
1861 spring travel. This was of
great benefit to farmers on the
Salt and Blue. In addition to
his farming operations he established
a trading post at the
point where the cut-off crossed
Salt creek. The post was also a
station for the Lusbaugh line of
stages between Nebraska City
and Fort Kearny, where they
connected with overland stages
to California. He served in the
territorial legislature, also the
state legislature, first term. In
1867 he was a leading advocate
for removal of the capital to
Lancaster county&mdash;only he
wanted it at Yankee Hill, south
of Lincoln.</p>
<p>An old biography of Mr. Cadman
says proudly that he never
drank a glass of liquor in his
life, not indicating, we hope,
that he was a rare exception to
a general rule. All in all he
was a hardy and to-be-relied-on
citizen, a worthy rival of salty
old Elder Young, who founded
the town of Lancaster and used
his influence to get the capitol
into Lancaster&rsquo;s successor, Lincoln,
instead of at Yankee Hill,
where John Cadman wanted it.</p>

<p>On a hot afternoon in July,
1867&mdash;the 29th&mdash;Commissioners
Butler, Kennard and Gillespie
emerged dripping from the attic
of Captain W. T. Donovan&rsquo;s
house. Standing on its east side
to avoid the blazing sun Butler
announced that henceforth Lincoln
would be the capital of Nebraska.
The severely fashioned
Donovan house stood at the
northern point of a triangle
which would have included the
Journal building and the Burlington
station had they been
built at that time. Why the commissioners
took to the attic to
vote on the site is not certain,
but possibly they did not want
to be rudely interrupted by those
who had been insisting that it be
located at Ashland, Seward or
Yankee Hill, or be left in Omaha.</p>
<p>Captain Donovan came to Lancaster
county in the mid-fifties.
Captain of the steamboat Emma,
one of the boats which plied up
the Missouri as far as Plattsmouth,
he was drawn to this region
by the possibilities of salt
in the Salt creek valley. His son
was the first white child born in
the county, his daughter the first
Lincoln bride. He took the first
homestead in the county under
the 1862 homestead law. He
stuck to his claim during the Indian
scare of 1864 and helped
protect settlers who had the
courage to remain. The tablet
was erected by the Nebraska
Society of the Sons of the American
Revolution.</p>

<p>The name Luke Lavender
seems inevitably to have been
coined by some feet-on-the-desk
writer of westerns, perhaps as
a brother in literature to the
outlaw Violet in MacKinley
Kantor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gentle Annie.&rdquo; But
Luke Lavender was not invented.
He was a rather important
citizen of Lancaster and
Lincoln, often referred to as
&ldquo;Judge&rdquo; and apparently also a
builder of carriages. He put up
the first house in Lincoln, at
what is now the southeast
corner of 14th and O&mdash;in 1864.
It was a neat log cabin with
two leantos, and to the south
and east stretched Mr. Lavender&rsquo;s
farm.</p>
<p>Try, for a moment, to erase
with one giant gesture all that
now means Lincoln. Visualize
a bit of lonely prairie, hummocky
and irregular. A creek
ran along the M and L street
region. A hill of considerable
height rose where the postoffice
now stands. The silence was
rarely broken. Light-footed antelope
made no sound as their
feet lightly trod the grasses and
their delicate ears pricked at
the sound of an occasional interloper.
The night, however, was
sharply punctured at intervals
by howls of wolves and coyotes.
To the west was the illusion of
perpetual snows, for Salt basin
was covered with an incrustation
of salt about a quarter of
an inch deep.</p>
<p>Mr. Lavender was an Englishman
who came here with Elder
J. M. Young in 1863. Among the
party were Jacob Dawson, who
a little later built half a mile to
the west of Lavender, Dr. McKesson,
Edwin Warnes, Thomas
Hudson, John Giles, Uncle Jonathan
Ball and others. These
settled elsewhere in Lancaster
county. It was Elder Young,
leader of the colony, who laid
out the town of Lancaster and
a little later started a female
seminary at 9th and P.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="653" />
</div>
<p>This is Oak lake, in Lincoln&rsquo;s
newest park&mdash;1st to 14th, Y to
Oak, 279 acres. If you are unimpressed,
please remember two
things: First, a nice expanse
of blue water is never to be
looked down the nose at, especially
in a prairie city. Second,
it is a wonderful improvement
on the magnificently proportioned
dumping ground which
used to occupy the same quarters,
and over which roamed
unfortunates peering and picking
at bits of refuse. Things
have been done to Oak creek, so
that its main channel now runs
thru the center of the park. Between
it and Salt creek lies the
lake, which members of the Lincoln
boat club rejoice in as a
place to hold races.</p>
<p>The park site was once a part
of the great salt flats whose
glistening white blanket drew
early settlers to Lincoln. In
fact, these saline lands took a
prominent part in the early history
of Lancaster county&mdash;in
the courts, in politics, and elsewhere.
Both Governor Butler
and J. Sterling Morton were involved.
Morton had put up a
log cabin on the flats and pre-empted
the basin in 1861. In
1870 Butler leased the flats.
Endless complications and lawsuits
resulted. In the end Butler
was forced to pay thousands of
dollars to the state.</p>
<p>The salt industry, from which
so much had been hoped, failed
for several reasons&mdash;importation
of cheaper salt from Utah,
the difficulty of forming large
areas into drying pans, and the
destructive rains and overflows
which for 80 years have bedeviled
the Salt creek bottoms.
The last named situation the
sanitary board has been battling
with renewed vigor since the
disastrous flood of May, 1942,
with considerable promise of
success.</p>
<p>Returning to the subject of
parks, Lincoln is liberally
sprinkled with them. We have
22, in assorted sizes.</p>

</div>
<p>One day in 1928 John F.
Harris, a New York financier
who had grown up in Lincoln
in the seventies and eighties,
met a boyhood friend who still
lived here. The rusty gate of
memory swung back&mdash;it had
been 40 years since Harris left
Lincoln&mdash;and sharply accentuated
before him stood the past.
In a rush of deep affection for
all that had gone into his boyhood
he immediately resolved
upon a memorial to his parents,
to be located in the city in which
he had grown to manhood. The
result was Lincoln&rsquo;s largest
park. His boyhood friend&mdash;George
Woods&mdash;picked out the
600 acre site and Mr. Harris
came to Lincoln and approved.
He was urged to use the family
name for the park, but when he
visited the site of his old home
at 16th and K and stood at the
graves of his parents in Wyuka,
he decided on another&mdash;one
which would name his parents
in a broader sense and include
all these with whom they
had toiled in the wilderness&mdash;Pioneers.</p>
<p>George Harris, the father,
came to Lincoln in the early
seventies as land commissioner
for the Burlington, and as part
of his work brought thousands
of people to the state. Later
one of the sons, George B. Harris,
became president of the
Burlington. John F. Harris
went to New York and became
a successful financier. It was
Mr. Harris&rsquo; wish not to drive
nature from the rolling stretch
of prairie presented to Lincoln,
only to help her turn her most
hospitable face to the city. One
of the hills forms a natural amphitheater
from which many programs
and services have been
heard. Lakes beautify the rolling
surface of the park. Herds
of buffalo and elk are a reminder
of the early days. Near
the east entrance stands a buffalo
in bronze, also given by Mr.
Harris, and made in Paris by
the famous sculptor, George
Gaudet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="small">No. 33&mdash;Smoke Signal, Pioneers Park</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p15a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="698" />
</div>
<p>The east entrance of Pioneers
is guarded by a bronze buffalo,
symbol of the prairie when creatures
of the plains drifted over
her face scarcely aware of the
existence of human beings.
Their cries, their calls, were for
themselves and the seasons. Yet
they were not entirely alone. In
and out of their orbit moved
the Indian, as drifting as were
the birds and the beasts. One
day he might spread his camp
in a valley, the smoke of his
campfire lifting to the heavens.
In a month, perhaps, he was beyond
the horizon. The grasses
rose slowly again and possession
of the earth came back to the
buffalo and the deer, the coyotes
and the meadow larks.</p>
<p>Then came the white man. An
early Lancaster county settler,
John S. Gregory, wrote: &ldquo;I
reached the present site of Lincoln
toward evening of a warm
day in September (1862). No one
lived there, or had ever lived
there previous to that date.
Herds of beautiful antelope gamboled
over its surface during the
day and coyotes and wolves held
possession during the night....
About a mile west on Middle
creek the smoke was rising from
a camp of Otoe Indians, and
down in the bend of Oak creek,
where West Lincoln now stands,
was a camp of about 100 Pawnee
wigwams. I rode over, and
that night slept upon my blanket
by the side of one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The placing of &ldquo;The Smoke
Signal&rdquo; (by Ellis Burman) in
Pioneers was a suitable gesture.
Its unveiling and dedication in
1935 was a picturesque, even
dramatic, occasion. More than
100 Indians attended the ceremony.
Chiefs of four Indian
tribes which had roamed Nebraska
sat their horses thruout
the dedication, grouped at the
top of the rugged hill which
faces the west and the setting
sun.</p>

</div>
<p>Antelope park rambles loose-jointedly
from the old federal
treasury columns at 24th and O
south to Sheridan boulevard. It
can be and is many things to
many people. Here families
spread their fried chicken for a
blue canopied feast, here the
children point their toes to the
sky as they pump up swings,
here the band begins to play&mdash;evening
and Sunday concerts.
Here the young people dance
the evening hours away, the
summer Indians brandish their
tennis rackets, the flower lovers
stroll and gaze at elaborately
laid out beds of flowers.</p>
<p>Or, calling all ages, there is
the zoological building on south
27th, where the monkeys chatter
and swing, the tigers shake
their bars and little creatures
of all kinds peer out from their
cages. Central in the zoo is the
scene above. Photographed thru
the screen which surrounds it,
it has the dreamlike quality
of a Chinese painting. Some
of the birds took to cover with
the appearance of a camera.
The scarlet ibis clings morosely
to a branch and an African
crane, with seedy headgear, is
in picturesque tete-a-tete with
another exotic bird in the foreground.
The stork, to the left,
legging its way as usual on the
heights, is obliterated except for
a beak and bit of curved wing.</p>
<p>The peace of this scene, with
its pool, its rocks and flashes
of bright color, is seldom disturbed.
When the keeper circles
the ledge symmetrically with
dishes of bananas and grain
the birds, big and small, float
noiselessly down and begin
pecking at their food in genteel
manner.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Tucked here and there thruout
Antelope park&rsquo;s pleasant
spaces&mdash;179 acres&mdash;are a number
of statues and memorials,
results of various impulses and
circumstances. We have mentioned
the pillars at the O street
entrance. Roaming southward
thru the park you will find
others. One of these objects is
the fountain given to the city
by the late D. E. Thompson
thirty or so years ago. It was
placed in the center of 11th
street a few blocks south of O.
As Lincoln&rsquo;s herd of automobiles
grew to thundering proportions
city officials realized
that the fountain, very suitable
in the days when ladies nodded
to each other across it from
phaetons and victorias moving
on either side, must be transplanted.
After a number of accidents,
some of them truly
tragic, the fountain was taken
to the park. Neptune, on one
side, had been permanently
crippled and the water nymph
on the other was doubtless aged
in spirit.</p>
<p>In 1936 the Lincoln park department
sponsored the putting
up of a war memorial&mdash;a marble
23-foot shaft topped by a figure
in ancient armour&mdash;spirit of war
and victory. On four lower
pedestals Revolutionary, Civil
war, Spanish-American and
World war soldiers look out,
each leaning on his instrument
of death. When Mr. Burman
and the park department planned
this statue they probably had no
thought that it would be so
quickly outmoded. No niche
has been provided for a warrior
of the present conflict.</p>
<p>Another figure in the park
is The Pioneer Woman, donated
by the Woman&rsquo;s club and the
park board. The trees along
Memory garden and Memorial
drive&mdash;north of Sheridan boulevard&mdash;were
planted in memory
of the Lincoln soldiers who fell
in the first World war.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="578" height="1000" />
</div>
<p>Nebraska&rsquo;s capitol, designed by
Bertram Goodhue, is one of the
beautiful buildings of the world.
Twenty years ago, disputatious
words were circling round its
budding tower&mdash;derogatory, complimentary,
acrimonious, laudatory.
But the capitol rose silently
thru this swarm of words and today
stands superbly in completed
perfection. Controversy has died
away, and there are probably few
Nebraskans who are not proud of
the capitol&rsquo;s majesty and timeless
beauty.</p>
<p>Opening a forgotten drawer recently
we came upon the dusty
drawings of Mr. Goodhue&rsquo;s rivals
in the capitol competition of more
than twenty years ago and found
them yawn-provoking. Only the
one chosen seemed alive, rising
into the sky, even on its yellowed
paper background, as tho from
some inner compulsion.</p>
<p>The capitol has many moods.
Sometimes she wraps a dark cloak
somberly about her. The next
time one turns to look, she shimmers
in a cloak of light. The
capitol is beautiful in all her
moments&mdash;silhouetted against the
blue, against storm or twilight, or
against the limitless background
of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="607" />
</div>
<p>The inspiration for the capitol
as a whole was Bertram
Goodhue&rsquo;s. He first ran an
architect&rsquo;s pencil around its
noble contours, in a moment of
exaltation flinging its tower
toward to stars. But death drew
the pencil from his hand while
many markings were yet to be
made.</p>
<p>It is said that for no other
building since the middle ages
has such a definite, complete
and comprehensive symbolic
scheme been worked out&mdash;giving
complete unity to the finished
edifice. To Mr. Goodhue&rsquo;s immediate
associates, of course,
goes a great deal of the credit
for the capitol. William Younkin
has been the supervising
architect. Among others who
had a large part in the perfecting
of the building are Lee Lawrie,
the sculptor, Hildreth
Meiere, responsible for its mosaics,
and Hartley Burr Alexander,
who planned the sculpture,
wrote the inscriptions and
worked out the art symbolism.</p>
<p>The late Dr. Alexander, native
of Lincoln and professor of
philosophy at the University of
Nebraska until he went to
Scripps college in 1927, was familiar
to two generations of
students in Lincoln. A mild retiring
person with a furiously
intellectual brow, he possessed
great ability in the field of
poetry and philosophy, writing
perhaps twenty books on these
subjects. The inscriptions of the
building read unhurriedly along
its vast corridors, beginning
with the hymn of the Navajo,
imprinted on the buffalo at the
north entrance: &ldquo;In Beauty I
walk. With Beauty before me
I walk. With Beauty behind me
I walk, with Beauty above and
about me I walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The capitol is the story, in
marble, of mankind. Its physical
outlines suggest this&mdash;sprawling
inarticulate humanity
drawn up finally into strength
and beauty. To amplify the story
in words would mean great book
piled on great book. For every
mosaic, every panel and every
rising pillar holds the tale of
some great struggle or advance
in the life of man. At last the
story is brought down to Nebraska&mdash;its
pioneers, its buffalo,
its Indians, its corn and wheat.
But before Nebraska comes the
whole great panorama of mankind.
The upward struggle
toward a high ethical code,
toward religion, is pictured in
great movements or incidents of
history.</p>
<p>The western group of nine
panels seen from the promenade
describes the development of law
in the ancient world: Moses
bringing the law to Mount Sinai;
Deborah judging Israel; judgment
of Solomon; Solon giving a
new constitution to the Athenians,
publishing of the law of the
twelve tables in Rome; establishment
of the tribunate of the people;
Plato writing his dialog on
the ideal republic; Orestes before
the Areopagites; codification of
Roman law under Justinian. On
the south wall of the promenade
are panels showing the magna
carta, signing of the declaration
of independence and writing of
the constitution. The eastern
group describes development of
law in the modern and western
world, panels including codification
of Anglo-Saxon law, Milton
defending free speech, signing of
the Pilgrim compact, Lincoln&rsquo;s
emancipation proclamation, the
Kansas-Nebraska bill and admission
of Nebraska as a state.</p>
<p>At the upper corners of the
tower eight sculptured figures
represent spiritual leaders of
civilization, including the prophet
Ezekiel, Socrates, Marcus Aurelius,
St. John, St. Louis, Isaac
Newton and Abraham Lincoln.
Abstract virtues, Wisdom, Justice,
Power, Mercy are represented
as human figures at the

<p>Today we shall give you a
few facts which include figures&mdash;the
latter of which we
have hitherto dealt out very
stingily.</p>
<p>The lower part of the capitol
is a square base, 437 feet each
way, which conceals four inner
courts formally landscaped. The
tower reaches into the air 400
feet. The figure of the sower
at the top is 20 feet tall and
stands on a 12-foot pedestal&mdash;a
shock of corn on a sheaf of
wheat. The sower weighs about
nine tons.</p>
<p>The four light colored pillars
in the foyer are the largest
single piece marble columns in
this country. They weigh approximately
sixteen tons each.
The chandelier which hangs in
the center of the building, is the
largest bronze chandelier of its
type in the world. Its bell part
is a single piece of pure bronze,
cast in New York City. The
whole chandelier weighs 3,500
pounds. It is 112 feet from the
floor to the ceiling from which

<p>In 1863 Elder Young founded
the town of Lancaster&mdash;to become
Lincoln four years later&mdash;on
his own 80 acre tract, which
cornered Luke Lavender&rsquo;s farm
at what is now 14th and O. The
village was to extend from 14th
to 7th and from O to Vine. As
the far-sighted elder bent
musingly over the white paper
which represented the future
town he saw a city strong in
church life&mdash;and even predicted
that it would some day be the
capital of Nebraska. Another
dream was of a female seminary&mdash;either
to induce families with
young ladies to come to the new
town or to make prairie damsels
into suitable wives and mothers
for his churchly city. Hovering
over the platted town his pencil
finally came to rest at 9th and
P as a site for the seminary.</p>
<p>Many of the lots into which
his farm was ribboned he gave
to county and school districts.
Money from the others went into
the seminary. That institution
burned in 1867, but Elder
Young&rsquo;s dream of a city of
churches was more enduring.
Between 1866 and 1870 Congregational,
Methodist, Presbyterian,
Christian, Baptist and
Catholic churches were organized
and built. These were forerunners
of present downtown
churches. Lincoln now has about
80 places of worship.</p>
<p>The First Presbyterian church
was organized April 4, 1869. Its
first two buildings were supplanted
in 1927 by the present
beautiful structure, one of whose
distinctions is having been
planned by the late Ralph
Adams Crams. Thus may it lay
claim to special brotherhood
with the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine and St. Thomas&rsquo;
church of New York City.</p>

</div>
<p>On July 4, 1870, while Lincoln
citizens were celebrating the nation&rsquo;s
birthday in shady groves,
as was their wont, there came
from the northeast a strange cavalcade.
It was a string of flatcars,
over which bowers of cottonwood
branches had been arranged, pulled
by a chortling little engine named
The Wahoo, which name probably
echoed the cries of the tugging
engine rather exactly. Under the
bowers sat travelers on improvised
seats, chatting excitedly. It was
the first passenger train to pull
into, or almost into, Lincoln. The
Burlington and Missouri rails had
been laid to within a mile of the
town and the company celebrated
by offering a free round trip from
Plattsmouth to Lincoln, which was
made at the exhilarating speed of
15 or 20 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Within the year George B. Harris
became Burlington land commissioner
and began colonizing
Nebraska on a grand scale. In
1870 Nebraska had 122,993 inhabitants,
and most of them lived in
the southeastern counties near the
Burlington&rsquo;s 2,500,000 acres. The
success or failure of the Burlington&rsquo;s
land department depended
largely on price and credit policies
adopted by the company. Mr. Harris
was given a free hand. Boundlessly
enthusiastic over the possibilities
of the state, he went at
the job like one seating himself
at a great organ. Towns sprang
up wherever his creative fingers
strayed. To the west appeared
quickly a string of alphabetical
stations&mdash;Crete, Dorchester, Exeter,
Fairmont, Grafton, Harvard,
Inland, Juniata, Kennesaw and
Lowell. The &ldquo;Mayflower&rdquo; colony,
&ldquo;Plymouth&rdquo; colony, colonies from
England and the east were soon
grouped over the landscape.</p>
<p>In the middle 80&rsquo;s the Burlington
shops were located at Havelock.
Thru the Burlington lines
flows the bloodstream of that part
of Lincoln. It thrives or grows pale
and listless according to the fortunes
of its railroad. The shops at
this moment are employing 750
men&mdash;550 in the mechanical department,
250 in the store. The
shops build cars, repair cars, overhaul
electrical equipment used on
the lines west of Lincoln and overhaul
working equipment such as
steam shovels and pile drivers for
the whole Burlington system.</p>

<p>One leap from the south entrance

mind our accelerating his step in
order to capture the attention of
the audience) and Gov. Dwight
Griswold, in gray suit and fedora,

<p>The house in which Governor
Griswold lives, successor to one

republican gubernatorial residents,
suggests noble living. It is generously
proportioned, deep bosomed,
its wide galleries edged with delicately
wrought spindles. Memories
jostle each other pleasantly in the
big house, which is acclimated to
sudden changes.</p>
<p>One republican governor and his
wife, Mr. and Mrs. Sam McKelvie,
preferred to live in their home at
140 So. 26th, where indefatigable
Mrs. McKelvie threw off lightly,
the actual work of caring for 21
rooms, with oil painting and associate
editorship of a magazine as
pastimes. For the rest, since 1900&mdash;before
that governors had to
look for places to live, too&mdash;each
governor&rsquo;s retinue has moved in
and fitted itself into its surroundings
in its individual way. Mr.
Griswold, for instance, hung his
grandfather&rsquo;s sword&mdash;its owner fell
in &rsquo;61&mdash;in the front hall and his
collection of autographed photographs
in the back parlor. Mrs.
Griswold marshaled treasured family
antiques into the guest room
against a background of George
Washington-Mount Vernon wallpaper.</p>
<p>Every governor&rsquo;s wife handles
with pleased fingers the beautiful
silver service with the aid of which
light refreshments were once dispensed
on the battleship Nebraska.
During legislative sessions especially,
the governor&rsquo;s home is
opened for many social gatherings.</p>

<p>If you drive in a long slow arc
from southernmost to northernmost
Lincoln, veering to the
right as you drive, you will pass
thru the parts of the city which
were not the result of growth of
the original town but sprang up
a distance away from some special
urge or circumstance. There
were five of them, like the isolated
fingertip prints of a
cupped hand. As Lincoln spread
the tiny towns spread also, until
they finally all met, embraced
and became one.</p>
<p>Driving from one to the other
thru these originally diverse sections
we feel subtle changes. It
may be that thoughts and processes,
personalities of those once
dominating each, are in some
way imprinted on each section.
Or it may be only that we happen
to know local history. To
the south is College View, its
nucleus Union college (Seventh
Day Adventist). Next in the
arc is Bethany, originally the
background of Cotner college
(Christian) and next its sister,
University Place, home of Nebraska
Wesleyan (Methodist.);
Havelock, a little to the north,
was born of the Burlington
shops. Last in the arc is Belmont,
planned as a beautiful city
50 years ago but now fallen from
that high estate. Its woolen mills
burned down, the railroad came
in the wrong way.</p>
<p>Above is the ivy covered main
building of Wesleyan, an institution
which has stood sturdily for
over 50 years, battling drouths
and depressions with one hand
and serving the Lord and
Methodism with the other. Attesting
the educational soundness
of its program was a recent
national survey showing Wesleyan
with a rank of 22 among
339 liberal arts college in the
proportion (36 percent) of its
students going into graduate
study thruout the country. A
greater proportion of graduates
has gone from its classrooms
into theological seminaries than
from any liberal arts college in
America.</p>

<p>When we downtown Lincoln
lunchers gathered in groups at
the board on Sept. 17, 1930, we
did not begin talking about the
stock market or fall fashions or
unemployment or our neighbors
or any of those things which usually
occupied our attention.</p>
<p>Even before reaching for the
menu or the sugar bowl everyone
burst out with one identical
topic&mdash;what had happened that
morning at 1144 O. We had
heard remotely about gangsters
and underworld affairs, but on
this fair September morning
hands from that other world actually
reached out and touched
quiet respectable Lincoln.</p>
<p>There were submachine guns
but no killing. Three men quietly
entered the lobby of the Lincoln
National bank, with a word
turned employes and customers
face downward on the floor,
scooped up currency, looted a
vault and were out again&mdash;into
a waiting sedan and away. One
of the largest bank robberies
ever to occur in America&mdash;$2,000,000
in currency and bonds&mdash;it
forced liquidation and closing
of the bank.</p>
<p>Gus Winkler, big time gangster
and member of Al Capone&rsquo;s
gang, confessed to knowledge of
the stolen bonds but established
an alibi so far as active participation
was concerned. Tommy
O&rsquo;Connor and Howard (Pop)
Lee were tried and given long
term prison sentences. Jack
Britt was released after two trials.
Winkler offered to return
$600,000 of the securities in return
for his freedom. After
much discussion and comment
on the advisability of such action
Winkler won the point. Bonds
valued at $575,000 were eventually
returned. (Their return,
Mr. Towle reminds us, saved
five small banks in Lancaster
county.) In 1933 underworld
enemies caught up with Winkler
and he went down fatally
wounded by machine gun fire.</p>

<p>This is Cotner college&mdash;Cotner
boulevard between Aylsworth
and Colby&mdash;back, back in the
early days of existence. The
grass around it appears to be
unbroken prairie growth. There
are no walks around the building,
not even paths. And yet
this is very much a picture of
Cotner now. After 1889, when
the college opened, a tide of
green washed up over the
campus&mdash;a whole grove at the
north and big sheltering trees
elsewhere. And so also did a
tide of youth sweep into the
building to give it life. Now
both tides have receded. And
still, Cotner does not represent
a totally lost cause. Young
people who wish to attend a denominational
college have merely
been deflected to other Christian
church institutions&mdash;Drake,
in Iowa, for instance, nearest
Nebraska.</p>
<p>A small church college is one
of those anomalous places where
students in the morning gaze
worshipfully upon a preacher
professor and in the evening
plot to put his cow up in the
belfry tower. Scattered over
the world as teachers, preachers
and missionaries, Cotner students
recall happy days here,
not only inspirational but full of
pranks and fun. The college
was named for Samuel Cotner,
who donated a large tract of
land in Bethany to the school.
Closely connected with the
school is the name of W. P.
Aylsworth, first chancellor and
later president emeritus, greatly
loved and revered by the procession
of students who passed thru
the college during his lifetime.
He was killed a number of
years ago, as twilight was approaching&mdash;on
Cotner boulevard,
named for the college, and near
the street named for him&mdash;by a
speeding driver who did not stop
and was never located.</p>

<p>You may have heard that, in
case you are absentminded on
Saturday, on Sunday morning
you can get a loaf of bread or a
roast in College View. That is
quite true, but such considerations
reduce College View to its
lowest terms. The fact that
most of College View observes
its Sabbath on Saturday is the
result of a deep religious conviction
which set up a college
and spread around it a sympathetic
community.</p>
<p>Union college (Seventh Day
Adventist) has 12 buildings and
many interesting features. One
of the most interesting is its
work program. More than 90
percent of its students, which
usually number around 450, pay
their way, at least in part, by
working on the college farm or
in its shops and buildings on the
campus.</p>
<p>For the first two-thirds of its
lifetime&mdash;the college, like Cotner
and Wesleyan, was started in
the late 80&rsquo;s&mdash;the town was
made up exclusively of those of
the faith. For longer than that&mdash;we
are not prepared to say
definitely whether or not this is
still true&mdash;much strictness was
observed in the life of the students.</p>
<p>The college now has a medical

part of a nationwide program
sponsored by the Seventh
Day Adventist denomination and
operating under the approval of
the surgeon general of the U. S.
army.</p>

</div>
<p>Early in the nineties, two companions
might almost daily be
seen on Lincoln&rsquo;s downtown
streets. Written and unwritten
history traces their footsteps
more minutely&mdash;into Don Cameron&rsquo;s.
Curious as to the sort of
fame which perpetuated the
name of Don Cameron we investigated
and found that he was a
restaurant keeper. The secret of
his popularity and enduring
memory seems to have been
that he furnished a good meal
for 25 cents.</p>
<p>Among the rising young men
of Lincoln who found a good 25
cent meal important were these
two companions. The shorter,
darker of the two, who resembled
a bundle of scantily
padded charged wires, was
Charles G. Dawes. The taller,
fairer more reserved young man
was John J. Pershing, then commandant
at the university. In
the restaurant, where they sat
at a table with other young men
who in the future would be Lincoln&rsquo;s
prominent citizens, they
discussed many things, Dawes
with animated forearms, Pershing
more sedate but square-jawed
and purposeful.</p>
<p>It was not until 1905, after
he was gone from Lincoln, that
Pershing married. A dozen
years later his wife and three
oldest children died in a California
hotel fire. It was then
that he established a home in
Lincoln for his sister, Miss May
Pershing, and his youngest child,
Warren. This is still known as
the Pershing home, and to it
General Pershing has often returned
for periods of visiting
and rest. For the most part,
this last great leader of the
American Expeditionary forces
of 1918 lives at Walter Reed
hospital in Washington.</p>

</div>
<p>From this house at 1301 H,
little changed since the nineties,
was Charles G. Dawes, later to
be vice president of the United
States and ambassador to Great
Britain, catapulted daily by
the boundless energy which
eventually shot him up to the
top in national affairs. Dawes
lived in Lincoln only eight years
(1887-1894), but he made a
quite indelible impression, as
will a red-hot little iron which
a housewife goes off and leaves
for a few minutes.</p>
<p>His mobile hands reached out,
in many directions. Everything
he touched seemed to thrive, his
fingers being to many things
what the green thumb is said
to be to gardens. His first law
suit in Lincoln won a case for
some Nebraska farmers who believed
they had been discriminated
against in the matter of
freight rates. Thus he gained
the reputation of being an anti-monopolist&mdash;which
he was not.
Even in his twenties he was
organizing utilities and starting
banks and building a fortune,
which eventually got up into the
millions. He was a born financier
and gained a wider reputation
as such on becoming President
McKinley&rsquo;s comptroller of
the currency.</p>
<p>For relaxation he loved to sit
at the piano and improvise. He
put on paper a number of piano
and violin duets. The best
known, &ldquo;Melody in A Major&rdquo;
or something of the sort, became
popular and often rolled
out to meet him in great volume
when he came back to Lincoln.
Once&mdash;not in Lincoln&mdash;he had
the whole Thomas orchestra
come to his home so he could
play along with it on the fife.</p>
<p>In a letter to The Journal Mr.
Dawes once said that the eight
years he lived in Lincoln he had
always regarded as the most
important in his life, and some
of the friendships then contracted
were most valued.</p>

<p>Wyuka is, we think, a beautiful
word, and especially so for
Nebraska. Listening to the
sound of it one hears not only
the lonely prairie wind but the
more cheerful call of prairie
birds.... And the name should
never be followed by &ldquo;cemetery,&rdquo;
which is redundant, and,
much worse, robs it of beauty.
It is an Indian word often interpreted
as &ldquo;place of rest.&rdquo; We
like still better the more literal
&ldquo;place to lie down and sleep.&rdquo;
At any rate, Wyuka is a beautiful,
peaceful spot, especially on
a still summer day, when sun
and shade lie side by side over it
and large white birds drift timelessly
on its quiet lagoon.</p>
<p>This is Lincoln&rsquo;s oldest burial
place&mdash;tho not the oldest in Lancaster
county. Pale folded hands
and open Bibles on pure white
stones and flat slabs from which
lettering is almost obliterated
indicate certain age. The records
show that it was founded
in 1869, not as a city but a state
cemetery. Many names of interest
may be found on its stones,
among them early governors
Nance, Poynter, Thayer, Mickey
and Aldrich. The founder of the
village of Lancaster, Elder
Young, was carried here when
his days were done.</p>
<p>Little more than half of Wyuka&rsquo;s
200 acres are laid out in
lots. The southwest corner is devoted
to an artificial lake bordered
with grass and shrubs.
Space to the north is for future
use. Sections on the north also
have been set aside for Civil war
and World war veterans. The
high iron fence surrounding the
cemetery once encircled the university
campus. It proved to be
a considerable hindrance to firemen
when fire broke out in the
museum years ago, and in 1924
it was transferred to Wyuka.</p>

<p>Five hundred and fifty-four
convicts now sit scowling in
their penitentiary cells. This
statement, however, is merely
to fix them in your minds. The
personnel of the old gray bastille
is in reality much more mobile
and active. The men make
things and do things, go to
school and have music and movies.
They live as pleasantly as
is possible with whatever guilt
hangs over their heads, and
within their narrowed boundaries.
For some who have lived
there, the view narrowed finally
to the sight of one black loop
against the gray dawn&mdash;or the
leaping of one fatal spark.
Seven were hanged from 1867
to 1920; eight have walked to
the electric chair&mdash;1920 to 1929,
date of the last case of capital
punishment.</p>
<p>In seventy-five years there
have been several outbreaks,
mostly minor ones. But on
March 14, 1912, there was a
more spectacular performance.
During a deep snowstorm three
prisoners, John Dowd, Shorty
Gray and Charles Morley, shot
their way out, killing Warden
Delahunty, Deputy Warden
Wagner and Usher Heilman.
Thereafter for a number of days
Lincoln people were reluctant
to plunge out into the neck-high
snow lest conspicuousness result
in their being picked off by a
convict or a member of a posse.
In the final windup of the chase
an innocent farmer, as well as
two of the convicts, were killed&mdash;a
total of six deaths for the
incident. The third convict,
Charles Morley, surrendered. He
was released from the penitentiary
about a year ago.</p>
<p>A somewhat sensational escape,
1922, was that of bad
man Fred Brown, who was not
only bad but quite antic in his
movements. He was variously
referred to as Kangaroo or
Chain-man Brown. One day he
would pop up in Omaha, then in
some peaceful Lincoln spot,
keeping citizens in a state of
uneasy dismay until he was
finally captured in the wilds of
Wyoming. On his second attempt
to break out, in 1925, he
was shot down and killed.</p>

<p>During its 75 years, Lincoln
has worked up to an excellent
school system, with three high
school buildings, three exclusively
for junior and 20 exclusively
for elementary grades. It includes
attractive and ample buildings and
high standards of education. There
is little now to indicate ordeals
of past schoolboard heroes who
kept an adequate school roof over
juvenile heads as Lincoln in its
hasty growth trampled down surrounding
cornfields.</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s first public school was
held in Elder Young&rsquo;s stone seminary
where The Journal now
stands&mdash;Mrs. H. W. Merrill at the
blackboard with a babe on one
hip. The seminary burned in
1867 and another stone schoolhouse
started at 11th and Q,
partly the product of town-held
festivals and dinners. But the
board announced when school began
that funds were exhausted
and it would have to levy a &ldquo;rate
bill of 50 cents per month, per
scholar, payable monthly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seventy years ago Lincoln
schools showed not a trace of
today&rsquo;s pattern. However, that
year school authorities looked
over their motley throng and for
the first time waved it into
groups. Out went these orders in
the fall of 1872: &ldquo;At the first
ringing of the university bell all
scholars of the primary grade
and those who will read in the
first and second readers and
begin the study of mental arithmetic
will meet at the stone
schoolhouse at the corner of 11th
and Q. Those who will read in
the third reader ... will meet at
the building on 12th street known
as the White schoolhouse. All
prepared to enter schools of a
higher grade will meet at the
building on O between 11th and
12th.&rdquo; The stone schoolhouse at
11th and J continued more or
less as a free and easy country
institution, without all that citified
grading.</p>
<p>But even in 1872 the high
school which was to serve students
at 15th and N for 42 years
had been started, and next year
it was occupied. From that date
Lincoln schools looked up and on.
The present building was placed
on its 15 acre grounds, J to Randolph
and 21st to 23rd, in 1915.</p>

<p>This rim-of-the-prairie picture
is of Veterans hospital. Here
men lie and think of war.
Planes thunder over their upturned
faces and they remember
the airplanes of 1918, tho a few
may be occupied with planeless
thoughts of San Juan Hill, and
a very few with moldy memories
of the blue and the gray.
Here, perhaps, war news is
taken&mdash;largely by radio&mdash;in
larger and more frequent doses
than anywhere else in Lincoln.
All the patients&mdash;capacity is
251&mdash;have been thru war somewhere.
Before long the doors
will swing open for a fourth
generation.</p>
<p>Veterans Hospital is probably
the first place in Lincoln to
practice the art of blackouting&mdash;a
wide precaution, for the hospital,
with its 28 subsidiary
buildings, off by itself on a hill,
sparkles at night like a row of
Christmas trees.</p>
<p>A few veterans at the hospital
are veteran patients&mdash;five or six
years&mdash;but only a few. The turnover
in most cases is more of
the pancakes-on-a-hot-griddle
sort. It is a general medical
hospital which does not handle
long, slow cases. There are 92
veterans hospitals sprinkled over
the country. Except in special
cases, each takes veterans
living nearest, so that those
treated here are mostly from
Nebraska or a narrow strip
around it.</p>
<p>The patients are not left alone
with their gloomy thoughts.
Tuesday and Saturday nights
they have movies. On Mondays,
Wednesday and Fridays there is
some other form of entertainment.
The hospital library contains
4,000 books, and if the
patient can&rsquo;t come to the library,
the library comes to the patient.
From now until Christmas occupants
will be busy making
next spring&rsquo;s American Legion
poppies.</p>
<p>If you, too, are puzzling over
the 28 buildings, check them off
as living quarters for attendants,
power plant, warehouses,
electric shop, plumbing shop,
utilities buildings, garages, etc.
etc.</p>

<p>To the child, grandmother
and grandfather were never
young&mdash;that was too far away
and long ago for him to picture
in the faintest degree. So with
cities and towns as we contemplate
them today. Our imaginations
are scarcely more elastic
than the child&rsquo;s. We see Lincoln
as it is now; Yankee Hill as it
is, or almost is not, today.
Seventy-five years ago they
were two little sisters, side by
side, quarreling over a pile of
blocks&mdash;the first state capitol.</p>
<p>The story is that when the
commissioners were on a tour
in search of a capital site they
were given a chicken dinner by
the ladies of Yankee Hill, followed
by ice cream, &ldquo;a treat
which astonished them greatly,
as it was undoubtedly the first
ice cream to be served in the
wilds of the salt basin.&rdquo; The
commissioners, nevertheless,
gave the prize to Lincoln.</p>
<p>And now, as in some parable
of two sisters, Yankee Hill, in
her barren old age, toils daily
in the making of bricks which
pile up to the magnification of
the fortunate sister, Lincoln.</p>
<p>The bricks works are almost
sixty years old. It is an interesting
fact that as late as 20
years ago there were nearly 50
brick plants in Nebraska. Gradually
they disappeared, for one
reason or another, one of which
was that the right kind of clay
can&rsquo;t be found just anywhere
one might throw up a factory.
There are now four in the state&mdash;at
Yankee Hill, Nebraska
City, Hastings and Endicott.
Yankee Hill, adjoining Pioneers
park on the southeast, makes
all kinds of brick, many of
which are used in Lincoln and
many shipped to other places.
Plant capacity is 80,000 bricks
a day.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="800" height="588" />
</div>
<p>Whitehall has romantic appeal,
for a number of reasons.
It was once the home of Mrs.
C. C. White, pioneer Lincoln resident
and Methodist, and, in its
calico and cornbread days, one
of Lincoln&rsquo;s first young ladies.
When in later years one of the
White daughters became the
wife of an Italian count there
was a general pleased feeling
of something or other&mdash;as that
east and west do sometimes
meet, or that it&rsquo;s just one step
from pioneer to peeress.</p>
<p>Mrs. White, who had presented
Wesleyan university with a college
building named for Mr.
White, long deceased, later gave
Whitehall to the state as a home
for children. There is sometimes
romance in Whitehall even yet.
We once wrote a story about the
children, picturing the one red
headed child, a good and wistful
little boy. The parents of red
haired twin girls, seeing the
picture, arranged to adopt him.</p>
<p>It is of course dangerous to
expose yourself to childish
charm at Whitehall&mdash;you might
come away a parent. Forty
years ago a train of New York
waifs was sent out thru Nebraska.
A woman, feeling idle
curiosity, went down to see the
train come into her small town.
As she stood on the platform
she noticed a small boy&mdash;he is
now a Lincoln man&mdash;walking
forward and looking up most
earnestly at all the people
around him. When he saw this
woman he took her hand and
said, modestly but confidently,
that he would like her to be his
mother. Altho already supplied
with a child of her own, the
woman found it impossible to
refuse. And, happily, he turned
out to be the best of sons and
the finest of men.</p>

</div>
<p>Encountered by another
heaven-kissing spire, so delightful
to look at, so difficult to encompass
in small space, we decided
to invite you inside St.
Mary&rsquo;s, to contemplate the high
altar and reflect on the enduring
work of that fiery first bishop of
Lincoln&mdash;Bishop Bonacum.</p>
<p>This advantageous position,
14th and K, was first snatched
by members of the Christian
church, who built an edifice very
like the one now standing opposite
the capitol. They lost it
during the 90&rsquo;s depression and
Bishop Bonacum took over, rebuilding
once after a fire had
well nigh demolished the church.</p>
<p>A cathedral is a bishop&rsquo;s
church and in it the first bishop&rsquo;s
successors, Bishops Tihen,
O&rsquo;Reilly, Beckman and Kucera
have presided. Since Msgr.
C. J. Riordan has become pastor
the entire basement has been
finished, so that it contains two
large halls. In one of them each
Sunday a second mass is celebrated
at 11 o&rsquo;clock, while the
solemn mass is celebrated upstairs.
From the kitchen each
school day noon are served hot
meals to the entire student body
of the Cathedral school.</p>
<p>University art classes each
year visit the church to sketch
its architectural beauty.</p>

</div>
<p>Those three sister territories,
University Place, Havelock and
Bethany, spread out side by side
in northeast Lincoln and once
quite separate divisions of the
city, were tied together as neatly
by the new Northeast high
school as three handkerchiefs
are secured by one knot in the
corners. Thus caught up, they
are a flag of friendly challenge,
not to say defiance, to wave
across to Lincoln high at 21st
and J. Overnight a feeling of
solidarity sprang up at the new
high school.</p>
<p>There had been murmurs when
the school neared completion
over a year ago that the name
Northeast was undesirable&mdash;that
it had a cold, damp sound and
that no one could love an institution
with such an appellation,
and so why not name it for some
Nebraska or national notable.
Others contended that the name
was not the thing&mdash;that dear old
Northeast could entwine itself
as firmly around the heart as
dear old VanWyck or Montmorency.</p>
<p>The latter seem to have been
right. The three lines of
youngsters we see converging
on Northeast these mornings approach
their new institution
smiling. Probably one could
learn to love Hogwallow school
if associations and surroundings
were pleasant. Speaking of appearances
and surroundings, the
picture above is a very inadequate
representation of the
building itself. The surroundings,
naturally still a little barren,
have been improved by a
cement walk, and with gravel
on 63rd.</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s third high school is
in College View.</p>

<p>Conquerors sweep thru a nation
or state bent only on conquest;
traders camp on its
borders intent only on immediate
gains; missionaries kneel on
its soil with the welfare of souls
in mind; pioneers break the sod
for the purpose of putting four
walls around their families,
bread in their mouths. It falls
to the historian to follow after
these men of one purpose, to
gather up the fragments; to
keep alive, in words at least,
the spark struck off by fleeing
hoof or flintlock or ringing ax.</p>
<p>Musing with half-closed eyes
one can see a throng of people
entering Nebraska, spreading
out over it in patterns interesting
and intricate. One can see
a giant, colorful picture painted
on the plains, even hear the
throng moving to simple slow
strains of music&mdash;and realize
how literature, painting, music,
are born of movements of
people, individual or en masse.</p>
<p>There is no lack of romance
in the building of Nebraska, beginning
with its Indians&mdash;ships
with adventurers and settlers
sailing far up the rivers; the
Mormon migration; the underground
railroad (slaves were
sold on the block in southeast
Nebraska in the early sixties);
the fight for the capital, the
building of the railroads (which
reminds us of Building of the
Union Pacific, given by the
Ballet Russe in Lincoln several
years ago); Wild Bill Hickok,
Doc Middleton and their brother
bandits; the struggle between
homesteaders and cow men in
the north and west of the state.</p>
<p>The State Historical Society,
state capitol (Dr. A. E. Sheldon,
superintendent) has all this
locked in drawer and file and
safe&mdash;except for interesting exhibits
spread on its walls. The
picture above, drawn at Omaha
for Leslie&rsquo;s Sept. 26, 1860, depicts
the arrival in that pioneer
village of the Jennie Brown,
bound for Fort Benton, Mont.
It is one of over thirty thousand
pictures filed by the librarian,
Martha Turner, pertaining to
the history of the state.</p>

<p>The time has come, we believe,
gently to remove the guide
who has been walking ahead in
these Lincoln explorations, and
to let those following&mdash;if there
are those following&mdash;go on, each
with his own sightseeing. Possibilities
have not been exhausted.
There are, for example, the
state orthopedic hospital, with
its bright-eyed little birds,
seemingly survivals of some
great battering storm; the state
reformatory, once a normal college
(a thousand tapped on its
door for admission 50 years ago
this fall), later a military academy
and now, last chance for
wayward boys and young men;
the state hospital, with its population
of 1,440, widely known
its treatments.</p>
<p>There are old houses, patient,
wise and worn; churches, each
with its own flavor, history and
problems; parks we have not
mentioned; hospitals and theaters.
The agricultural college,
apple cheeked sister of the university
we have inadvertently
neglected.</p>
<p>If you are interested particularly
in the historical aspects of
a community you will visit the
historical society museum in the
capitol. Here time will cease for
an afternoon as in spirit you
move rapidly from 1842 to 1942
and back again to 1842, your
fingers touching visible evidence
of periods between those dates.
For Nebraska had its white people
even before 1842&mdash;its fur
traders, trappers, missionaries.
In Bellevue, first Nebraska
town, first territorial governor
Francis Burt took his oath of
office Oct. 16, 1854&mdash;only to die
two days later in the log cabin
home of Rev. William Hamilton.</p>
<p>... In short, we commend all
ramblers into the past to the
state historical society. It will
serve as an excellent guide to
early Lincoln and Nebraska.</p>
<p>And so, goodbye.</p>

<p>Streets running east and west are either alphabetical or named.
Alphabetical streets begin at the southern boundary of the original

south of A and north of Y to and beyond the city limits.</p>
<p>Block and house numbers begin at O street north and south
end at 1st street east and west. Streets north or south of O are
designated by the prefixes N and S respectively. Addresses West
of 1st street are designated by the prefix West, abbreviated W. For
example, 534 W. Washington. Odd numbers appear on the west
and south sides of the streets and even numbers appear on the
east and north sides.</p>
<p>The location of each street is indicated by showing the number
of blocks north or south of O, or east or west of 1st. The length
of the street is indicated by showing the streets at which it begins
and terminates. For example, Apple street is shown as follows:
Apple&mdash;10th N of O...27th to 40th. This indicates Apple street is

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
